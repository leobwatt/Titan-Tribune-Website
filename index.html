        the more advanced band who have taken beginner band or already play a band instrument.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Ms. Yau is the music teacher at Templeton. She decided to become a music teacher because she really
        enjoyed the music program when she was in high school and continued with it in post secondary. Her favorite instrument
        is the piano, and it is also the first she learned to play. Her favorite part of band is working with the students and
        she likes being inspired by everybody.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Megan Cheng has been in band for 2 years and plays the clarinet and the alto saxophone. Her favorite
        part of band is being able to joke around in class because everyone is so close and friendly. She’s most excited about
        the whistler trip in the spring and the possible trip to Disneyland in her grade 12 year. Her advice to people who are
        trying to learn a new instrument is to keep practicing and to be patient with yourself.</p>

        people who are learning a new instrument is to have interest in it and to not force yourself or else you won’t have
        any motivation to learn.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Anica Gorlick is a beginner trombone player and joined band this year. Her favorite part of band is
        playing a song and it coming together as the melody, harmony, and base. She’s most excited about playing for people at
        concerts later this year. Advice she would give to people who want to play a new instrument is to do your best and
        keep practicing and to join band because it’s fun and a good experience.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Francis Reyes currently plays the trumpet and the alto saxophone in concert band. His favorite part of
        band is playing music and watching other people improve. He is most excited about seeing the band improve. Advice he
        would give to someone who is learning a new instrument is not to see it as a task or a job and just have fun with it.

      <p class="paragraph">Luca Siracusa is in grade nine and plays the drums for concert band. His favorite part of band is when
        everyone plays together and becomes one whole band. He is most excited about the concerts coming up because he knows
        we will play well. His advice to people learning a new instrument is to keep moving forwards and try your hardest .
