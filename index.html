    <!--Band Interview By Anna Segelken-->

    <div class="article">
      <p class="title">Club Interviews - Band</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Interviewed by Anna Segelken</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The Templeton music program offers a variety of opportunities for students. It is run by Ms. Yau.
        Beginner band is open to anyone who wants to learn how to play an instrument with a group of people. Concert band is
        the more advanced band who have taken beginner band or already play a band instrument.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Ms. Yau is the music teacher at Templeton. She decided to become a music teacher because she really
        enjoyed the music program when she was in high school and continued with it in post secondary. Her favorite instrument
        is the piano, and it is also the first she learned to play. Her favorite part of band is working with the students and
        she likes being inspired by everybody.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Megan Cheng has been in band for 2 years and plays the clarinet and the alto saxophone. Her favorite
        part of band is being able to joke around in class because everyone is so close and friendly. She’s most excited about
        the whistler trip in the spring and the possible trip to Disneyland in her grade 12 year. Her advice to people who are
        trying to learn a new instrument is to keep practicing and to be patient with yourself.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Tiffany Vo has also been in band for 2 years, and she plays the flute. Her favorite part of band is the
        craziness of the class because it makes it more fun. She is most excited for the band trips this year. Her advice to
        people who are learning a new instrument is to have interest in it and to not force yourself or else you won’t have
        any motivation to learn.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Anica Gorlick is a beginner trombone player and joined band this year. Her favorite part of band is
        playing a song and it coming together as the melody, harmony, and base. She’s most excited about playing for people at
        concerts later this year. Advice she would give to people who want to play a new instrument is to do your best and
        keep practicing and to join band because it’s fun and a good experience.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Francis Reyes currently plays the trumpet and the alto saxophone in concert band. His favorite part of
        band is playing music and watching other people improve. He is most excited about seeing the band improve. Advice he

      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Luca Siracusa is in grade nine and plays the drums for concert band. His favorite part of band is when
        everyone plays together and becomes one whole band. He is most excited about the concerts coming up because he knows
        we will play well. His advice to people learning a new instrument is to keep moving forwards and try your hardest .

      <!--Climate-Friendly Agriculture By Anna Segelken-->

      <div class="article">
        <p class="title">Climate-Friendly Agriculture</p>
        <p class="paragraph">By Anna Segelken</p>
        <img src="ClimateArticleImg.jpg" id="climateAgricultureImg" width="327" height="184">
        <p class="caption">This module at CubicFarms harvests about 9,500 heads of lettuce per month. (CBC News)</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Agriculture currently generates 19-29% of total greenhouse gas emissions globally, making it one of the greatest-emitting sectors in the world. Some agricultural practices lead to habitat loss and deforestation. Fields are doused in herbicides and pesticides that can be toxic in large quantities, not just for animals, but also for humans. These chemicals pollute waterbodies through runoff, where water runs over farmland and into waterbodies, carrying some chemicals with it, and harm ecosystems through bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation occurs when animals ingest small amounts of chemicals, and then larger animals eat these animals (and the chemicals inside them), which causes the chemicals to build up inside certain species or ecosystems over time. Furthermore, “with a global population expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, there’s a need to increase food production by 70% in the next 30 years to ensure enough food for everyone and avoid further food insecurity”, according to the UN. Evidently, this is a problem that needs to be solved. But how?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">One solution is to look back on older methods of farming. Organic farms (farms that do not use synthetic herbicides or pesticides, and rotate fields), cover crops (crops that are grown to protect the soil, not be harvested) and fields with more than one type of crop, such as intercropping (growing multiple types of crops together to maximize resources) and companion planting (growing certain crops together that help each other thrive) These farming systems have been in use for decades and are methods that preserve soil health, prevent runoff, and decrease the need for pesticides.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Another option is to build indoor farms. This negates the need for pesticides and herbicides, and these farms are easily climate controlled, which is useful during heat waves and</p>
        <p class="paragraph">cold snaps. This allows them to have year-round operations. This method of farming uses less water than conventional farming methods, and the crop yield is much more reliable so it can help with food security issues as well.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Cell fabrication of meat is also a possible way forward. Cells are extracted from live animals, and then they are grown until there is enough volume for a full cut of meat. As this is still meat made from animal proteins, it is a great source of protein. This method of meat production reduces greenhouse gas emissions and antibiotic use, in addition to being far better for animal welfare.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">There are many routes we can take to address climate change and, more specifically, the role agriculture plays in it. If this is going to be economy driven, then we need to keep researching and innovating, as new technology will be the answer. If this is going to be community-focused, with grass-roots organizations, then the emphasis should be on going back to the old ways of farming. Either way, we need the government to encourage these new innovations, and we need the public to embrace them.</p>
